Inspiration: Bisexual people experience more disparities, such as poverty and violence, than lesbian and gay people (MAP, 2014). Are there differences in the disparties that bisexual men and bisexual women experience? What are they and how do we address them?

Key Findings
* Bisexual men are more likely to experience physical attacks by multiple perpetrators while bisexual women are more likely to experience sexual attacks by perpetrators who are alone. Majority of perpetrators for bisexual men and bisexual women (76%-88%) during their most serious attack/threat were male, although the perpetrator(s) for bisexual men was slightly more likely to be male than for bisexual women.

What can we do with this information?
1. Conduct a study that targets perpetrators to identify why they physically/sexually attack or threaten bisexual. 
2. Create educational programs based on the conclusions of the study with the goal of changing the behavior of perpetrators and potential perpetrators. 
3. Create an educational program that specifically targets male perpetrators and potential male perpetrators. 
4. Create education programs that help potential victims learn how to deal with different types of potential perpetrators.
